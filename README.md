TileGame
========

2D TileGame Base on Mario gamedesign
The main purpose of this wasn't the game but the architecture it lay on. 
I've let this go when a though this was too complicated.

I've made another version base on an Entity/Component game engine made by myself. You can found it here https://github.com/Canadadry/TileGameV2
